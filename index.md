* [Kansas Boycott](_posts/kansas-boycott.md): On the 26th of February, 2026 Kansas published the "House Substitute for Senate Bill 244" making it the law of the state. The bill overrides the governor's veto and immediately invalidated the state issued ID (including driver's licenses) of transgender people in Kansas whose ID has been updated with a gender marker that matches their identity.
