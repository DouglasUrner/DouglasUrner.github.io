# Kansas Boycott

As of the 26th of February, 2026, "driving while trans" in Kansas is now a crime. Under [House Substitute for Senate Bill 244](https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/sb244/) it is now a misdemeanor to drive with a Kansas issued license where your gender marker does not match the sex you were assigned at birth. You face the possibility of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Inmates in Kansas jails are housed according to sex assigned at birth. The bill was passed over the governor's veto on the 23rd of February. It went into effect on the 26th, there was no grace period. Trans people in Kansas woke up this morning with no way to legally drive – even to the DMV to get a new license.

Erin Reed of _Erin in the Morning_ has been reporting on this, you can find her coverage [here](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/kansas-sends-letters-to-trans-people).
